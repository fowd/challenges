<h1>Final Project Requirements</h1>
<h2>Content</h2>

<p>Your final site should have the following pages:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Home page</strong> (index.html): This page may have a brief (artist/mission) statement, artwork/work, or other introductory material</li>

<li><strong>Contact page</strong> (contact.php): You will have a contact form you will develop in the next module, allowing visitors to the site to send you an email ... you will also have a thank you page, after the form is submitted</li>

<li>A page (or pages) with <strong>your main material</strong> ... this could be a <strong>portfolio</strong> gallery, your ministry, or product; each page should be named accordingly (i.e. gallery.html, ministry.html, widgets.html). You may have to create multiple galleries, if you want to showcase specific areas. You could also use Javascript and create &quot;tabs&quot;</li>

<li>A page that talks more <strong>about you</strong> (about.html) ... If you don't have a great deal to say, make this your resume page -- talk about your qualifications (your skill set and education). If you need, place your artist statement on this page too.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Single Page layout</h3>

<p>You could compress all the content into one single HTML document. However, they do become extremely long and you must remember to keep the navigation where people can always get to it (fix the position or repeat the navigation in each section). Once again, Tabbed layouts could be used.</p>
<h2>Coding Requirements</h2><h3>CSS</h3><h4>Reset</h4>

<p>

<span class="warning">You must have at least a basic reset on your main css document
</span> (this is the CSS document that is listed first in your order)</p>


<pre>* {margin: 0; padding: 0;}
</pre>
<h4>Organize</h4>

<p>Make sure you <strong>organize your CSS</strong> to the best of your ability. Try to group rules together that deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Layout</li>
<li>Typography</li>
<li>Lists</li>
<li>Anchors</li>
<li>Misc</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, you could divide up your CSS that deals with the front page and interior page layouts and typography</p>

<p>Make sure all CSS documents <em>that you create</em> are in a folder called &quot;css&quot; (all lowercase).</p>
<h4>Validate</h4>

<p>Make sure you <strong><a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" title="The W3C CSS Validation Service">validate your code</a></strong> for any major errors. Remember, try to have the validator check for CSS3 and avoid using too many vendor prefix rules (e.g. -webkit- and -moz-)</p>
<h3>HTML</h3><h4>Validation</h4>

<p>Make sure you <strong><a href="http://validator.w3.org/" title="The W3C Markup Validation Service">validate your code</a></strong> to catch any errors!! 

<span class="warning">Any errors will result in major point deductions
</span>.</p>
<h4>Structure</h4>

<p>Make sure you're not using too many <code>div</code>s and that you're using the <code>id</code> and <code>class</code> attributes (and correctly -- <code>id</code>s can only be used one time per page!)</p>
<h4>Semantics</h4>

<p>Is your use of header tags appropriate? Make sure you don't skip and there should only be one h1 tag per page. 

<span class="warning">If you use an image for the title of your page, this is the best solution
</span>:</p>


<pre>&lt;h1&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;index.html&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;images/sitetitle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Site Name Here&quot; title=&quot;return to site name homepage&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre>
<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<p>Make sure you organize your JavaScript and any plugins (gallery, slideshow, tags, etc.) appropriately. While some JavaScript (like the jQuery framework code) will be in a folder title &quot;js&quot;, some will be in it's parent plugin folder (fancyBox gallery, etc.).</p>

<p class="warning">Make sure you see me well before the final submission deadline, if you have questions or concerns!</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Make sure you test your site thoroughly!</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the site look in (at least) Chrome/Safari and Firefox?</li>
<li>Does the form work?</li>
<li>Does the gallery work?</li>
<li>Can you have one of your friends go through your site and not be confused?</li>
<li>Again, don't forget to validate</li>
</ul>
