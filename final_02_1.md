## Responsive Design Challenge.
While it's easy to simply design for one layout (desktop), you should start to add in additional sketches and wireframes for mobile devices. At this point, keep it simple and consider a phone width of 320 pixels, tablet at 768 pixels, and 960px for desktop. 
**Advanced:** For those of you who want more of an advanced challenge, add in widths of 480 pixels, 1024 pixels (wide tablet) and 1200 pixels (desktop).
