  <h1>Final Project Submission</h1>
  <h2>Description &amp; Requirements</h2>
  <p>Here's the finish line! You are to now submit all your hard work as a finished website. Here's a checklist of required items:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For a more complete checklist, make sure you <a href="http://aumoodle.andrews.edu/mod/page/view.php?id=118264">view the Final Project Checklist</a> under the &quot;Resources&quot; section.</li>
    <li>Make sure the code (HTML and CSS) validates</li>
    <li>Are your images in the gallery a good size for web?</li>
    <li>Test that your site shows (nearly) consistently in all modern browsers (Firefox, Safari, Chrome and (if you can) Try it out on Internet Explorer (7 or higher))</li>
    <li>Make sure you contact form works (remember, you need to use the server for this) ... and that the user gets a &quot;thank you&quot; message; can I navigate to other parts of your site too?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Tools</h2>
  <p>HTML editor, Image editor, and any other tools to help finish the project.</p>
  <h2>Submission</h2>
  <p>After you've completed your site, and done all the testing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>upload your project folder (<strong>final-lastname</strong>)—compressed in the ZIP or RAR format</li>
    <li>upload your site to the server ... you do not need to have this in a folder—the site can be at the root level</li>
    <li>Add the link to your site in the &quot;Notes&quot; area below</li>
    <li>Finally, provide a link in the <a href="">corresponding discussion</a>.</li>
  </ul>
