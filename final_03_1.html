    <li>Make sure the code (HTML and CSS) validates</li>
    <li>Are your images in the gallery a good size for web?</li>
    <li>Test that your site shows (nearly) consistently in all modern browsers (Firefox, Safari, Chrome and (if you can) Try it out on Internet Explorer (7 or higher))</li>
    <li>Make sure you contact form works (remember, you need to use the server for this) ... and that the user gets a &quot;thank you&quot; message; can I navigate to other parts of your site too?</li>
  </ul>
