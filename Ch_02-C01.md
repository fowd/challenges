# A2.1 - Text Elements

## Purpose

Learn how to structure content using HTML text elements.

## Description

For this assignment, you'll use the index.html document from the previous assignment. Simply duplicate your previous folder (with the index.html) and then rename it to **a2_1-yourlastname**.

## Requirements

### HEAD element

Add one `meta` element that has the following information:

- Adding Meta Data to the `meta` element
-- Add the attribute `name=` with the value of `"author"`
-- Add the attribute `content=` with the value of `"[your name]"` — add your name and remove the square brackets

### BODY Element

In this section, you'll add semantic (meaningful) text elements and add additional content

- Step 1: Adding Header text elements.
-- Add a header text element level 1 ( `h1` )element around "Foundations of Web Design".
-- Add a header text element level 2 ( `h2` )element around your name.
-- Place a `div` element that surrounds both `h1` and `h2` elements and add an `id` attribute of `"header"` to the opening `div` tag.
- Step 2: Creating an Unordered List
-- After the closing `div` tag, add an unordered list element ( `ul` ) with the following items within individual list elements ( `li` ):
--- HTML
--- CSS
--- JavaScript
-- Add an `id` attribute with the value of `"nav"` to the opening `ul` tag.
- Step 3: Adding a paragraph
-- After the closing `ul` tag, add a paragraph element ( `p` )
-- Add the following text within the `p` element:
--- *An introductory course developed to familiarize students with the design and creation of Web pages and Web sites. Students will learn basic HTML structure along with basic styling with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).*
-- Add an emphasis ( `em` ) element around the word "introductory"
- Step 4: Adding a quote
-- After the closing `p` tag, add a `blockquote` element that has the following content:
--- *If you want to learn web design, make a website.*
-- Make sure you wrap the text you added above in a paragraph ( `p` ) element.
-- Add a `cite` attribute to the opening `blockquote` tag with the following website value url: `http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2538-the-first-step-is-to-start`
-- After the text, add a `footer` element.
-- Within the `footer` element, add the text: *- 37 Signals*.
-- Add an inline `cite` element around "37 Signals" (not including the dash)—but make sure its contained within the footer element and *only* around the text.
-- Push yourself further ... While you don't know about adding links (yet), you know how to add HTML elements, attributes and values:
--- Add an anchor element ( `a` ) around "37 Signals" (not the dash(-))– **Note:** make sure the `a` element is within the `footer` element!
--- Add the `href` attribute to the opening a element with the value: `http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2538-the-first-step-is-to-start`
- Step 5: Adding a final `div` element
-- Add an opening `div` tag before the `p` tag that starts "An introductory course..." and give it an `id` attribute with the value `"main"`.
-- Add a closing `div` tag after the closing `blockquote` tag that contains the quote from "-37 Signals"
