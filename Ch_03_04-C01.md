# Chapter 03 & 04 - Links, Objects, Tables

## Purpose

Use what you've learned this module and add more content to your site.

## Requirements

Work through the following step, paying attention to each step in detail. If you have questions—or need clarification—make sure you ask. However, make sure you try and work through the step as much as possible before asking.

### Duplicated Previous Assignment
- make a copy of your previous assignment folder
- rename the folder to **a3_1-yourlastname**
### Add an Image
- On your home page (index.html), add a picture (photo or illustration) of yourself. Make sure the image is in a folder named "images".
- NOTE: For now, the size should be no wider than 150 pixels and not taller than 150 pixels.
- THINK: Are you choosing the right format for what you are showing–should you use a GIF, JPG, or PNG?
- Place the img element just above the `h1` element but within the div that has the `id` attribute of "header".

## Create A New Document

In this step, you'll create a new HTML document that will have the same basic global structure elements as the index.html document, but with different content between the body element.

### Creating a Document
Create a new HTML document to your assignment folder called "html.html"
Like the index.html, it should have the `doctype, `html`, `head`, `meta`, `title` and `body` elements
- NOTE: You can copy the index.html and simply change the content between the `title` tags and `body` tags

In the html.html document, you're going to add the following video:

``http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8YQN64HsYM``
[ or some other video from YouTube or Vimeo]

``<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/V8YQN64HsYM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>``



### Embedding the Video
Go to the video on YouTube [teacher: provide a link to the video on YouTube] — right-click on the link and select: "Open Link in a New Tab"
- Below the video, click the word: Share
- Then click the word: Embed
Before copying the code in the little window, look at the text: Video Size
- Make sure the first option is set to Custom Size
- In the next field, set the value to: 420
- The next field should automatically be: 315
- NOTE: In the checkboxes below, make sure "Use old embed code [?]" is not checked!
Now, copy the iframe code and paste in the code between the body tags in the html.html document

**Note:** The embed code provide by YouTube does not include the `http:` or `https:` before the rest of the URL -- you must add `http:` before the double forward slash `//` for the embedded video to work.

The code you now have should look like:

``<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vid0l1nkEx" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>`` ``</iframe>``

**NOTE:** Don't copy and paste the example above, it won't work! You must follow the directions above.

Table of Contents

In the next set of steps, you're going to add a table below your video

Create the table
After the closing iframe tag, add the table element to your document.
Adding Table Rows
Within the table element, you'll add your data:
Add a thead element
Within the thead element, add a tr element
Within the tr element, add a th element and add the text: Foundations of Web Design: HTML and CSS
In the opening th tag, add the colspan attribute with the value of "2".
Add a tbody element after the closing thead tag
Within the tbody element add a tr element
Within the first tr element add two td elements
Within the first td element, add the text: Chapter 1
Within the second td element, add the text: HTML Foundations
After the first closing tr tag, add another tr element
Within the second tr element, add two td elements
Within the first td element, add the text: Chapter 2
Within the second td element, add the text: Text Elements
After the second closing tr tag, add a final tr element
Within the third tr element, add two td elements
Within the first td element, add the text: Chapter 3
Within the second td element, add the text: Links &amp; Objects
Add a tfoot element after the closing tbody tag
Within the tfoot element add a tr element
Within the tr element, add a td element and add the text: Author: Thomas Michaud
In the opening td tag, add the colspan attribute with the value of "2".
Styling your Table

While we could add borders to our table using HTML, we want to use CSS for presentation (design). Since you've not had an introduction to CSS yet, simply copy the highlighted CSS style element below and paste it between the opening and closing head tags–a good place is just after the title element:

``<head>``
``<title>...</title>``
``<style type="text/css" media="screen">``
``  table, tr, th, td{border:1px solid black;}``
``  th, td{ padding: 4px;}``
``</style>``
``</head>``

Add Link

Whoah! We need a way to get to the html.html page from your index.html page! Let's go back to the index.html page for a moment.

You're going to create a relative link to the html.html document (how original!). So, here's what you need to do:

Creating a Hyperlink
Create an a tag that wraps around the word "HTML" in your li.
Add the href attribute to the opening a tag.
The href attribute should have a value that finds the html.html document... wait, did I just give you the answer?
After you save the index.html document, open it in a browser and see if the text HTML is blue and underline. If it is, click on the text to see if it opens the html.html document in your browser.

If the link works, move on to the final step
If the link doesn't work, go through the steps and double check your work.

## On Your Own
Now, can you add a link on your `html.html` document that gets you back to the index.html document?
Take a close look at the screenshot below, what do you notice was added that I haven't told you? Can you add the correct text headings, and other elements that you don't have? Just think it through. There's nothing new you have't done! The only thing you don't need to worry about is adding is any divs to the html.html document.

## Screenshot

Here is the index.html document:
