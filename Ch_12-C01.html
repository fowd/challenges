  <h1>A12 - Contact Form</h1>
    <p>A contact form is an essential part of a site. It helps friends, customers, and others get in contact with you whether they're on their own computer or not. In this exercise, you'll implement a simple contact form, add a little bit of style.</p>
    
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>To help people contact you when they visit your Web site.</p>
    
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>You will create a contact form for you final site. While I don't expect you to know how to program PHP to make the form work, you are provided enough instruction to modify what is needed to make the form work.</p>
  <p>While the form doesn't need to be completely stylized to the design of your final project at this point, we do want it to work. Make sure you upload the form to the server to test; submit a link (below) to your server once you've successfully tested</p>
  

  
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>While the requirements are noted below, <a href="files/a12-contact-instructions.pdf">Download the detailed instructions of the assignment</a>.</p>
  
  <h2>Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a href="files/a12-files/contact-lastname.zip">download contact-lastname.zip</a></strong> assignment folder</li>
    <li>After uncompressing the folder, rename the contact-<strong>lastname</strong> to your own lastname (ex. contact-michaud)</li>
    <li>Create a <i>thanks.html</i> document and add the necessary content.</li>
    <li>In the <i>sample.txt</i> document (in the <i>autoresponse</i> folder), change &quot;Your Name Here&quot; to your name.</li>
    <li>Add and Modify, according to the directions, the:
    	<ul>
    		<li><i>contact.html</i> document</li>
    		<li><i>contact_process.php</i> document</li>
    		<li><i>css</i> > <i>form.css</i> document</li>
    	</ul>
    </li>

  <h2>TEST, TEST, TEST</h2>
  <p>While you open the contact.html document in your browser&mdash;from your desktop&mdash;you cannot test to see if the contact form works. You must upload your contact folder to the web server so the contact_process.php document can process the form.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Upload to your server space</li>
    <li>Test the your form
      <ul>
        <li>if not successful, review the steps, make needed changes, and test again</li>
        <li>Once you successfully test the script, post the link the assignment page</li>
      </ul> </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Tools</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>HTML editor</li>
		<li> Web server</li>
	</ul>
	
  <h2>Submission</h2>
  <p>You are to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>place all your files in a folder entitled: contact-<em>lastname</em> (<strong>ex. <em>contact-michaud</em></strong>)</li>
    <li><strong>Additionally:</strong> upload the folder to the Web server (make sure you test that your form works) and then provide a link in the &quot;notes&quot; area below. <em>Make sure your link is &quot;clickable&quot;</em></li>
  </ul>
