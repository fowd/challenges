<h1>Final 2.2 - Website Sketches &amp; Wireframe</h1>
<h2>Description &amp; Requirements</h2>
<p>You will be developing a minimum of three (3) sketches (like the midterm) and a minimum of one (1) wireframe (like the midterm) for your personal website. Remember, by having a plan of action, you can save time prior to coding your site.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>By developing sketches and wireframes, you can quickly develop your HTML structure and CSS design.</p>
<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>Pencil/pen and paper for sketches. InDesign or Illustrator for wireframeâ€”Download Templates</p>

<h2>Responsive Design Challenge.</h2>
<p>While it's easy to simply design for one layout (desktop), you should start to add in additional sketches and wireframes for mobile devices. At this point, keep it simple and consider a phone width of 320 pixels, tablet at 768 pixels, and 960px for desktop.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced:</strong> For those of you who want more of an advanced challenge, add in widths of 480 pixels, 1024 pixels (wide tablet) and 1200 pixels (desktop).</p>
